# VPN Docs

In order to access the cluster, a VPN gateway and corresponding local OpenVPN client can be set up.

1. Setup OpenVPN client.
    ```
    bash vpn-client.sh
    ```

2. (Optional) Generate kubeconfig. In should be generated by the Terraform configuration in `rke2.kubeconfig`; but the cluster may not be ready when the Terraform script tries to fetch the kubeconfig from the keyvault. In this case, the kubeconfig can be downloaded from the keyvault:
    ```
    bash fetch-kubeconfig.sh
    ```


In order to ssh into the VMs, you need to use the corresponding certificate:
```
ssh -I .ssh/rk2_id_rsa rke2@<vm_ip>
```
